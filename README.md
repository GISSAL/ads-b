# Python Toolkit for using ADS-B Data to Understand Overflight Travel Patterns at U.S. National Parks

### Objectives

The objectives of this proposal are to effectively track low-level overflights above NPS units, improve data processing, comprehensively describe spatio-temporal characteristics of overflight travel patterns, identify when and where overflights may be impacting terrestrial visitor experiences, and produce 8-12 park-specific reports annually to assist the NPS in developing 23 total air tour plans. Additionally, this proposal includes intuitive data processing toolkits designed for both the achievement of this project’s deliverables and for future use by NPS staff, including those who are not GIS specialists. These easy-to-use toolkits simplify and expedite complicated data workflows and produce outputs that provide information about overflight travel patterns that will be beneficial when addressing overflight compliance, evaluating amendments of air tour plans, and adaptively managing air tours. To accomplish this, we propose a multi-module custom GIS “toolbox” that processes, analyzes, and creates visualizations from ADS-B data that meets the immediate needs of managers. 

GIS tools will be organized in a custom toolbox called the ADS-B Overflight Toolkit (Figure 1).  This toolkit will be designed for Esri’s ArcGIS geoprocessing environment as a custom toolbox and can be used locally to clean raw ADS-B Data, process and analyze data, develop descriptive summary statistics, conduct spatio-temporal analyses, and output a standard series of tabular and graphical results.
