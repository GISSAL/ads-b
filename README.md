# Python Toolkit for using ADS-B Data to Understand Overflight Travel Patterns at U.S. National Parks

GIS tools will be organized in a custom toolbox called the ADS-B Overflight Toolkit (Figure 1).  This toolkit will be designed for Esriâ€™s ArcGIS geoprocessing environment as a custom toolbox and can be used locally to clean raw ADS-B Data, process and analyze data, develop descriptive summary statistics, conduct spatio-temporal analyses, and output a standard series of tabular and graphical results.
